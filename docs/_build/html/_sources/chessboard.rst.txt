Internal Board Representation
===================================

**chessengine** uses bitboards to represent a chess board internally. A bitboard
is just a 64-bit integer in which each bit corresponds to one square on the chess
board (since a chess board also has 64 squares). A 1 at a certain position means
that a piece is present on that square, and a 0 means that no piece is present
on that square.

The board is defined in the :ref:`chessengine.bitboard.Board <Board>` class. It
stores the bitboards of all pieces for each side as attributes with the naming

convention ``<side>_<piece>s``. For example, you can access the bitboard
corresponding to black bishops by accessing the ``black_bishops`` attribute
on your ``Board`` object.

Available Attributes
--------------------

The following attributes are available on the :ref:`chessengine.bitboard.Board <Board>` class -

Attributes For Chess Board
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* ``all_pieces`` - A bitboard representing the positions of all pieces on the board
* ``board`` - A dictionary mapping tuples of the format ``(side, piece)`` to the corresponding bitboard. For example, ``board[("white", "pawns")]`` returns the bitboard corresponding to white pawns.
* ``moves`` - A list of all moves made on the board. Moves are stored as a tuple in the format ``(start, end, captured_side, captured_piece, captured_bitboard)`` where start is the :ref:`position <position_representation>` the piece started from, end is the position the piece landed on, captured_side is the side of the piece captured (if any, else ``None``), captured_piece is the piece captured (if any, else ``None``), and captured_bitboard is the bitboard of the captured piece before it was captured (used to restore it in case we want to undo moves).
* ``piece_count`` - A dictionary mapping tuples of the format (side, piece) to the number of pieces of that side on the board currently. For example, at the start of the game ``piece_count[("white", "pawns")]`` will be 8.
* ``side`` - The side of the board. Can be ``"black"`` or ``"white"``.
* ``opponent_side`` - The side of the opponent. Can be ``"black"`` or ``"white"``
* ``en_passant_position`` - The position on the board to which a pawn can move to capture a pawn of the opposite side by en passant. Set to ``0`` if no en passant move can be made in the current turn.

Attributes For White Side
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

* ``white_bishops`` - A bitboard representing the positions of all white bishops on the board
* ``white_kings`` - A bitboard representing the position of the white king on the board
* ``white_knights`` - A bitboard representing the positions of all white knights on the board
* ``white_pawns`` - A bitboard representing the positions of all white pawns on the board
* ``white_queens`` - A bitboard representing the positions of all white queens on the board
* ``white_rooks`` - A bitboard representing the positions of all white rooks on the board
* ``all_white`` - A bitboard representing the positions of all white pieces on the board

Attributes For Black Side
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

* ``black_bishops`` - A bitboard representing the positions of all black bishops on the board
* ``black_kings`` - A bitboard representing the position of the black king on the board
* ``black_knights`` - A bitboard representing the positions of all black knights on the board
* ``black_pawns`` - A bitboard representing the positions of all black pawns on the board
* ``black_queens`` - A bitboard representing the positions of all black queens on the board
* ``black_rooks`` - A bitboard representing the positions of all black rooks on the board
* ``all_black`` - A bitboard representing the positions of all black pieces on the board

Representing Positions On The Board
-----------------------------------

The squares on the chessboard are numbered as follows -

.. image:: media/chessboard-numbered.svg
    :width: 300
    :alt: A chessboard with indices assigned to each square

All positions on the board are specified as a power of 2, where the power is the index according to
the diagram above. For example, to refer to the square ``c2``, you would pass ``2**10`` to whichever
function you are working with, and to refer to the square ``e5``, you would pass ``2**36``.

All functions in ``chessengine.moves`` accept ``position`` as an argument, which is specified
as mentioned here. In general, all functions that accept a ``position`` argument require it to
be specified as mentioned here. Moreover, the ``Board.move`` function also requires this format for
its ``start`` and ``end`` arguments.

To help with converting between coordinates on the board, positions, and powers
of 2, you can use the ``chessengine.lookup_tables`` module.
